# Snippette.js

I think every JS developer can agree; there is a lot of typing involved in creating an app.
Thus I decided to create this much needed JavaScript library.

## Getting Started

This library contains many functions that will spare you a whole lot of time when creating JavaScript applications.

### console.log()

The ```console.log(value);``` method is simply shortened to ```cl(value);```

### document.querySelector()

The block of code ```var myElement = document.querySelector('.myElement');``` will be shortened by a lot;
```var myElement = dq('.myElement');```
Is that shorter, or what?
